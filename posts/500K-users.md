**Revolt Celebrates 500,000+ Users Milestone**

It's been just a bit more than a year since our [last post on the topic](https://revolt.chat/posts/100K-users), and yet, we cannot believe that we are already writing another post on it. It is our greatest pleasure to inform everybody that **Revolt has _officially_[^1] passed the 500,000 user mark!**

Reaching half a million users is a monumental milestone for us, and we owe it all to our incredible community and tireless team. Over the past year, we’ve not only expanded our user base but also worked on a slew of new features designed to make your Revolt experience even more top-notch. Here's what's coming right to your end user devices in the near future:

## Better Mobile Apps

We've heard you, you're all tired of using the web apps on mobile. That's why more than a year ago, we decided to start developing entirely new Android and iOS apps written from scratch and super-optimised. Check out those ✨fancy✨ screenshots:

Reminder that you can join the [Google Play Beta](https://rvlt.gg/android) (see #getting-into-beta) and [iOS TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/mGSCJe13) to help us build the apps of your dreams.

## Pinned Messages

Until now, we all had to make do without pinned messages. Some even found creative workarounds around this, like using Bots or the search bar. Not anymore. We're happy to announce that we've just received a fresh shipment of message-certified pin needles in all the important colours[^2], and pinned messages will gradually start being available over the coming time.

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow services to send events to other services, right as they happen. Say, if someone makes a payment to you via Stripe, or you got a new pull request to "review" on GitHub, those services can send those events to a Webhook. With Revolt's Webhook integration, you will be able to send those events right into a channel. This means that you will soon be able to use Revolt to build a live event feed into your server. Just, maybe, don't make that Stripe payment log public.

## A Note on Availability

We've had quite the user influx recently, so forgive us if things are a little slow. We're working on not only scaling the service up to a more appropriate size, but making sure future scaling[^3] is possible. Please check out [status.revolt.chat](https://status.revolt.chat) if you're unsure whether things are crashing and burning at our data centre right now!

## Big Journey

We'd like to end this post with a heartfelt **THANK YOU** to everyone who was involved in the evolution of Revolt over the past 4 years, it's definitely been a journey. This also includes you, the users. This would not have been possible without you!

That's all for now, have fun. We'll see you again for our 1 billion users milestone, and maybe a couple times before that.

[^1]: By "officially," we mean our cadre of specially trained raccoons at the Bureau of Totally Legitimate Statistics certified it while wearing tiny suits.
[^2]: Purple. We only got them in purple.
[^3]: According to our calculations, in the year 2274 every human being in the multiverse will be using Revolt, and only Revolt.
