**Revolt** can cater to your community, raid guild, study group, and anything in-between. We encourage you to:

-   Take advantage of our powerful community tools.
-   Be kind and make friends with others on our platform.
-   Have fun collaborating, communicating, and sharing content.

Online communities have the potential to change people's lives, so we want to encourage a positive environment for anyone willing to join.

## Keeping You Safe

To ensure users stay safe on the platform, we explicitly disallow:

-   **Violent Extremism**

    Content that promotes, encourages, or glorifies violent extremist ideologies or activities is not permitted on our platform.

-   **Misinformation & Conspiracy Theories**

    Spreading false or misleading information that can cause harm to individuals or society is prohibited. This includes conspiracy theories that have been debunked or lack credible evidence.

-   **Hate Speech & Hateful Conduct**

    We define hate speech as any form of expression that attacks, promotes harm, or promotes hatred against other people based on their protected characteristics.

    We define the following as protected characteristics: age; caste; colour; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee or immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class and status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking; and weight and size.

-   **Promoting, Encouraging, or Glorifying Self-Harm or Suicide**

    This includes any content that pushes people to cut or injure themselves; that embraces eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia; or that encourages people to commit suicide as opposed to referring them to the correct treatment and help. If you notice someone in need of urgent help, please contact your local authorities.

-   **Promoting, Organising, or Engaging In Illegal Behaviour on Platform**

    Any content or activity that violates applicable laws is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to:

    International laws: Widely recognized international laws and treaties.  
    Laws of our jurisdictions: As outlined in the "Jurisdiction" section below, we are bound by and enforce laws within specific jurisdictions due to our operational locations and data storage.

    Users are responsible for ensuring their activities comply with all applicable laws and ignorance is not a valid defence for violations.

-   **Promoting off-platform content that violates our acceptable usage policy**

    Sharing links or references to external content with intent to promote content that violates our Community Guidelines is not allowed.

-   **Sharing content designed to harass or degrade someone, or that can directly threaten someone's physical, mental, or financial state**

    This includes any content that would violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). We respond to DMCA requests as described in our [Terms of Service](https://revolt.chat/terms).

-   **Unsolicited advertising**

    Creating accounts or using existing accounts to send unsolicited advertisements to other people on the platform.

-   **Financial scams / fraud**

    Any attempt to deceive users for financial gain, including phishing, multi level marketing, or other fraudulent activities.

-   **Buying and selling of Revolt accounts**

    The transfer of Revolt accounts for monetary or other compensation is not permitted.

-   **Selling, purchasing, or providing means to artificially grow servers**

If you're unsure whether a growth strategy violates this policy, please contact our support team for clarification.

    Attempting to circumvent bans or other moderation actions by creating new accounts or using alternative methods to access the platform is prohibited.

This also includes attempts to gain access to our backend networks. _Please contact us ahead of time for permission to test our networks by emailing [security@revolt.chat](mailto:security@revolt.chat)._

-   **Abusing our server resources**

    Using Revolt with malicious intent, in a way that is not reasonable under normal usage, in order to outsource computing and/or storage resources to our servers, as well as other forms of Denial of Service to our infrastructure.

-   **Automation of user actions**

    Automated activity from user accounts that is performed without explicit, manual initiation by the account holder is forbidden.

-   **Misleading the support team**

    Providing false information or making fraudulent reports to our support team is prohibited.

## Reporting Violations

To report any of the above activity, please use the in-app reporting system. If you cannot use the in-app reporting system for any reason, please contact us at [abuse@revolt.chat](mailto:abuse@revolt.chat).

## Strikes and Suspensions

Violations of these Community Guidelines, or other platform terms, may result in strikes against your account. Strikes are irreversible. Account suspensions can be removed through a successful appeal, but only if you believe that we took the wrong action. There is no point asking to be appealed for breaking the law.

If you wish to appeal a suspension, please contact [abuse@revolt.chat](mailto:abuse@revolt.chat).

In certain cases, we may take action based on off-platform behaviour, particularly when it involves severe violations of our policies or legal issues.
