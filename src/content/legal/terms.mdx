It is important however to remember that these terms are legally binding between yourself and us if you choose to use Revolt, so please read them carefully before proceeding - We will continue to improve and tackle some sections.

### Definitions

-   **Terms** – the Terms of Service, a legally binding agreement between Us and You ("Terms", "Terms of Service")
-   **You** – the user ("you", "your" or "user")
